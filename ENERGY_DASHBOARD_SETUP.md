# Setting Up Home Assistant Energy Dashboard with SolArk

## Overview

With version 5.0.0+, the SolArk Cloud integration is fully compatible with Home Assistant's Energy dashboard. You can track solar production, grid consumption, battery usage, and home consumption all in one place.

## What Gets Tracked

The Energy dashboard can track:
- ✅ **Solar Production** - Energy generated by your panels
- ✅ **Grid Consumption** - Energy imported from the grid
- ✅ **Grid Return** - Energy exported to the grid  
- ✅ **Home Consumption** - Total energy used by your home
- ✅ **Battery** - Energy charged and discharged

## Prerequisites

1. **Integration installed** - SolArk Cloud integration v5.0.0 or newer
2. **Sensors working** - Verify sensors show data in Developer Tools → States
3. **Energy dashboard enabled** - Home Assistant 2021.8.0 or newer (Energy dashboard is built-in)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access Energy Dashboard Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Energy**
2. Or click **Energy** in the sidebar (if visible)
3. Click **Add Energy Configuration** (first time) or the **gear icon** (if already configured)

### Step 2: Configure Solar Production

1. In the Energy Configuration, find **Solar panels**
2. Click **ADD SOLAR PRODUCTION**
3. Select: `sensor.solark_energy_total`
4. Click **SAVE**

**Why this sensor?**
- `sensor.solark_energy_total` is a cumulative counter (TOTAL_INCREASING)
- Home Assistant calculates daily/monthly production from this
- This tracks your total lifetime solar production

### Step 3: Configure Grid Consumption and Return

The integration provides native energy sensors for grid import/export using a
trapezoidal (Riemann) integration of the power sensors.

1. Under **Grid consumption**, click **ADD CONSUMPTION**
2. Select **Energy consumed from the grid**: `sensor.solark_grid_import_energy`
3. Under **Grid production** (if you export):
   - Click **ADD RETURN**
   - Select `sensor.solark_grid_export_energy`
4. Click **SAVE**

### Step 4: Configure Home Battery (Optional)

If you want to track battery energy flow:

#### 6a. Create Battery Energy Helpers

**Battery Discharge Energy:**
1. Create Riemann sum helper
2. Input: Create a template sensor first (see below)
3. Or skip battery tracking for now (it's complex)

**Note:** Battery energy tracking is more complex because you need to separate charge vs discharge. This requires template sensors to split the battery_power into positive (discharge) and negative (charge) components first.

### Step 5: Verify Configuration

1. Wait 1-2 hours for data to accumulate
2. Go to **Energy** dashboard
3. You should see:
   - Solar production graph
   - Grid consumption/export
   - Home consumption (if configured)

## Advanced: Battery Energy Tracking

To properly track battery energy, you need to create template sensors that split charge/discharge:

### Create Template Sensors

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      # Battery Discharge Power (only positive values)
      - name: "Battery Discharge Power"
        unique_id: battery_discharge_power
        unit_of_measurement: "W"
        device_class: power
        state_class: measurement
        state: >
          {% set power = states('sensor.solark_battery_power') | float(0) %}
          {{ max(0, power) }}
      
      # Battery Charge Power (only negative values, converted to positive)
      - name: "Battery Charge Power"
        unique_id: battery_charge_power
        unit_of_measurement: "W"
        device_class: power
        state_class: measurement
        state: >
          {% set power = states('sensor.solark_battery_power') | float(0) %}
          {{ max(0, -power) }}
```

Then create Riemann Sum helpers for each:
1. `sensor.battery_discharge_energy` (from `sensor.battery_discharge_power`)
2. `sensor.battery_charge_energy` (from `sensor.battery_charge_power`)

Finally, add to Energy dashboard:
- Battery systems → ADD BATTERY SYSTEM
- Energy going in: `sensor.battery_charge_energy`
- Energy going out: `sensor.battery_discharge_energy`

## Troubleshooting

### "Sensor not available" in Energy Dashboard

**Cause:** Energy dashboard only accepts sensors with `state_class: TOTAL_INCREASING` or `TOTAL` for cumulative counters.

**Solution:** 
- Use `sensor.solark_energy_total` for solar (it has the correct state_class)
- Use `sensor.solark_grid_import_energy` and `sensor.solark_grid_export_energy` for grid

### "Statistics not available"

**Cause:** New sensors need time to build up statistics (usually 1-2 hours).

**Solution:** Wait and check back later. Home Assistant builds statistics in the background.

### Graphs Show Flat Lines

**Cause:** No data variation yet, or sensor not updating.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify sensor updates: Developer Tools → States → Check sensor timestamps
2. Wait for solar production (during daylight hours)
3. Check integration is working: Settings → Devices & Services → SolArk Cloud

### Energy Values Seem Wrong

**Causes:**
- Battery Riemann Sum helpers created recently (they start from zero)
- Integration was offline/unavailable during periods
- Power sensor reporting incorrect values

**Solutions:**
1. Give it 24 hours to accumulate accurate data
2. Check power sensors show reasonable values
3. Verify integration scan interval isn't too slow (30s recommended)

### Reset Energy Statistics

If you need to start fresh:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** → **Statistics**
2. Find your energy sensors
3. Click **Fix Issue** → **Delete All Statistics**
4. Confirm deletion
5. Statistics will rebuild from current time forward

## What You Can Do with Energy Dashboard

Once configured, you can:

- ✅ Track daily/monthly/yearly solar production
- ✅ Monitor grid import vs export
- ✅ Calculate self-consumption percentage
- ✅ View energy flow diagrams
- ✅ Track costs (if you add electricity rates)
- ✅ Compare time periods
- ✅ Export data for analysis

## Adding Electricity Costs (Optional)

To track costs:

1. Go to Energy Configuration
2. Under **Grid consumption**, click the **pencil icon** next to your grid sensor
3. Check **Use an entity tracking the total costs**
4. You can either:
   - Enter a **fixed price per kWh**
   - Or select a **sensor** that tracks your electricity rate

Home Assistant will then show cost calculations in the Energy dashboard.

## Energy Dashboard vs. Your Custom Dashboard

**Energy Dashboard** (Settings → Dashboards → Energy):
- Built into Home Assistant
- Automatic graphs and statistics
- Shows cumulative energy over time (kWh)
- Best for long-term tracking and cost analysis

**Your SolArk Custom Dashboard** (`dashboards/solark_flow.yaml`):
- Real-time power monitoring (W)
- Instant power flow visualization
- Live status indicators
- Best for moment-to-moment monitoring

**Use Both!** They complement each other:
- Custom dashboard for "What's happening right now?"
- Energy dashboard for "How much energy this month?"

## Example Complete Configuration

Here's a complete configuration.yaml section for full energy tracking:

```yaml
# Template sensors for battery split
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Battery Discharge Power"
        unique_id: battery_discharge_power
        unit_of_measurement: "W"
        device_class: power
        state_class: measurement
        state: >
          {% set power = states('sensor.solark_battery_power') | float(0) %}
          {{ max(0, power) }}
      
      - name: "Battery Charge Power"
        unique_id: battery_charge_power
        unit_of_measurement: "W"
        device_class: power
        state_class: measurement
        state: >
          {% set power = states('sensor.solark_battery_power') | float(0) %}
          {{ max(0, -power) }}
```

Finally configure Energy dashboard:
- **Solar**: sensor.solark_energy_total
- **Grid Import**: sensor.solark_grid_import_energy
- **Grid Export**: sensor.solark_grid_export_energy
- **Battery In**: sensor.battery_charge_energy
- **Battery Out**: sensor.battery_discharge_energy
